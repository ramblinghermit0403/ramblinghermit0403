# 👋 Hi, I’m Himansh Shivhare

I build **intelligent systems that connect AI reasoning with real-world tools**, with a strong focus on **agent orchestration, scalable backends, and memory-driven AI platforms**.

My work lives at the intersection of:
- **LLM agent architectures**
- **Distributed & event-driven systems**
- **Practical AI infrastructure (production-first, not demos)**

---

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

### 🔹 Agent Bridge — *MCP Tool Orchestrator*
An intelligent orchestration layer that interprets user intent, selects the right tools from connected **MCP servers**, executes them securely, and synthesizes a final, comprehensive response.

**Core ideas**
- Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- Tool discovery & execution abstraction
- Secure, permissioned agent actions
- Real-time agent telemetry and streaming outputs

---

### 🔹 MemWyre / Brain Vault — *AI Memory Infrastructure*
A persistent, cross-LLM memory layer that enables users to **store, retrieve, and reason over knowledge** across chats, tools, and agents.

**Key capabilities**
- Semantic memory ingestion (files, web, chat, MCP)
- Intelligent inbox for memory triage (approve / discard)
- Vector search + contextual chat
- Real-time updates via WebSockets
- Designed to work *with* any LLM, not replace one

---

## 🛠️ Technical Focus

### Backend & Systems
- FastAPI, REST APIs, OAuth2, JWT
- Event-driven architecture, WebSockets
- RabbitMQ, Redis, async processing
- PostgreSQL, SQLite, ChromaDB
- AWS (cost optimization, reliability, scaling)

### AI / LLM Infrastructure
- Agent orchestration & tool routing
- MCP client & server implementations
- Embeddings, retrieval, chunking strategies
- Memory design for LLMs (short-term + long-term)
- LangChain, LlamaIndex (used selectively)

### Frontend
- Vue.js 3, Pinia
- Real-time state synchronization
- Clean, minimal, developer-first UX

---

## 📌 Engineering Principles

- Abstractions that survive scale
- Cost-aware architecture (no over-engineering)
- Reliability > novelty
- User-controlled intelligence
- Systems that work across models, not locked to one

---

## 📈 Highlights

- Reduced cloud costs by **50%+** through architectural redesign
- Processed **20,000+ async messages/month** with zero message loss
- Built real-time agent systems supporting high concurrency
- Designed memory systems that remain useful *after the chat ends*

---

## 🔍 Interests

- Autonomous & semi-autonomous agents
- AI + developer tooling
- Memory as infrastructure
- Cross-LLM interoperability
- Turning research ideas into usable systems
