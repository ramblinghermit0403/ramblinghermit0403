# 👋 Hi, I’m Himansh Shivhare

I build **intelligent systems that connect AI reasoning with real-world tools**, with a strong focus on **agent orchestration, scalable backends, and memory-driven AI platforms**.

My work lives at the intersection of:
- **LLM agent architectures**
- **Distributed & event-driven systems**
- **Practical AI infrastructure (production-first, not demos)**

---

## 🧠 What I’m Working On

### 🔹 Agent Bridge — *MCP Tool Orchestrator*
An intelligent orchestration layer that interprets user intent, selects the right tools from connected **MCP servers**, executes them securely, and synthesizes a final, comprehensive response.

---

### 🔹 MemWyre / Brain Vault — *AI Memory Infrastructure*
A persistent, cross-LLM memory layer that enables users to **store, retrieve, and reason over knowledge** across chats, tools, and agents.

---

- Systems that work across models, not locked to one
